 # **Website A/B testing**

![](figures/figure1.jpg)

## 1. Introduction
This is an A/B testing project that was made to see if a new version of a sign up button in a website is better than current one. This A/B testing was made using a Multi-Bandit Armed (MAB) approach with a bayesian agent.

# 2. Business Problem.

iSketch company designs a software that makes 3D prototype projects for civil construction. This software is a Software as a Service (SaaS) and to use it you need to get an annual subscription.

One of the best ways of acquiring customers is getting their e-mail when they signing up company weakly newsletter about civil construction and 3D protoypes.

Therefore, improve conversion rate of website that capture customer e-mails is very important to ramp up number of customers.

A new design for the website was made with the sign up button in a different color in order to increase conversion rate. The new sign up button would be red and actual one is blue.


The marketing team would like to see if new design has a conversion rate better than current one.


# 3. Business Assumptions.

* Conversion rate would be related to number of clicks in sign up button. That would be number of sign up clicks (success) divided by total number of visits

* Two websites was created to simulate scenarios with blue and red sign up button

* An API randomly selects which website will be shown

* A webscrapper was made to simulate customer behavior in these websites. Also, 



# 4. Tools used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Git and Github
* VS Code
* Flask
* HTML
* Multi-armed bandit with a Bayesian Approach (Thompson Agent)

# 5. Dataset

Dataset was generated by using a webscrapper that simulates customer behavior in both websites. The webscrapper simulates 10000 customers. The columns generated are the following:


* visit - assign value of 1 for each row/customer
* click - Customer click in sign up button (0 for no and 1 for yes)
* no_click - Difference between visit - click
* group - Assign value of 'control' if customer see current website design and 'treatment' for those who see new one


# 6. Solution Strategy

THe strategy to solve this was:

* Design what type of test will be used (Multi-Armed Bandit with Thompson agent)
* Choose of metric of interest
* Definition of posteriori distribution (beta-binomial distribution)
* Definition of priori distribution (beta distribution)
* Define maximum accepted loss ( 5% )
* Design test infrastructure (define endpoint, API, two websites, agent)
* Design two 'fake' websites with different buttons colors
* Create an API in flask to run websites
* Create a webscrapper
* Getting data
* Calculate probability of page B be better than page A



# 9. Business Results
The business report answering are the following:

* Who are the eligible customers to participate in the Insiders program?

    **There is a list of customers based on their ID that will be handed to business people showing the eligible ones to Insiders program.**

# 10. Conclusions

The model did a good job finding insiders customers and their characteristics. Also it would help company does more selective actions to customers such as marketing campaigns, cross-selling and up-selling actions. That way it could reduce churn and increase revenue.
